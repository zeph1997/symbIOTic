## Short Description
### Problem Statement 
Due to global warming there will be an inevitable increase in the ambient temperature. As a result, First Responders are more likely to suffer from heat related injuries and strenuous working environments.  

### Introduction 
Our solution for SCDFxIBM Call for Code 2020 is to develop an app which monitors the heat acclimatization of first responders and their bodily response during operations using software provided by IBM built on Android and Wear OS, and further integrating it with wearable technology. Our solution would not only strengthen the safety and health of first responders during operations, but also further improve performance by having quantitative data to help develop training programs subsequently.   

### Concept 
Abundant data can be gathered from monitoring First Responders during their operations and training. With a simple wearable device, we can monitor the heart rate, oxygen level and more. If irregularities are detected, a warning is immediately sent to ground commanders for further follow up action. Superiors are then able to further observe these vital statistics to plan and execute commands on the ground, enhancing the safety of first responders during operations.  
On a HQ level these data points can be observed in real time to understand how all the different operations are playing out simultaneously. These data points can be further processed to understand how the performance during operations can be improved and developed into further training guides.
